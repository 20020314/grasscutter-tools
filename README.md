## Usage

Need to Server use with the [plugin](https://github.com/jianxingxuejian/grasscutter-plugin/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

Before you use the client, you should complete the easy certification first(send a verification code via in-game mailbox to your game to complete the verification within 1 minute or verify with the password of the game account). If you are the server owner, you can use the Server-Console on it after completing the admin certification.
